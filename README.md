# UK-Traffic-Accidents-Analysis
This project analyzes UK road traffic accident data to explore trends, contributing factors, and suggest improvements for road safety.

## Files Included
- `accidents_data.csv`: The dataset containing accident information.
- `analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the data and generating insights.

### Required Libraries

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `sqlite3`: For working with SQL databases (no need to install, as it's part of Python's standard library).
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `scipy`: For scientific computations and statistical functions.
- `numpy`: For numerical computing.
- `mlxtend`: For frequent pattern mining and association rule learning.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- `folium`: For creating interactive maps.
- `itertools`: For creating iterators for efficient looping.
- `imblearn`: For machine learning with imbalanced datasets (including SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler).

To install these libraries, you can use the following:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn scipy numpy mlxtend scikit-learn folium imbalanced-learn

## How to Run the Notebook

You can run the notebook in the following ways:

### Option 1: Run Locally with **Jupyter Notebook**
To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed. You can install it via pip if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook

3. Download the notebook and dataset to your local machine.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
5. In the browser window that opens, navigate to the analysis.ipynb file and open it.
6. Run the cells in the notebook to start the analysis.

You can also run this notebook on Google Colab without needing to install anything locally.

### Option 2: Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the link below:
- [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YourUsername/YourRepository/blob/main/analysis.ipynb)

1. Upload the dataset (`accidents_data.csv`) to Colab if prompted.
2. To use SQL in Google Colab, you may need to install the required packages:
   !pip install sqlalchemy sqlite3
3. Run each cell in the notebook to start the analysis.

### Project Structure

- `traffic_accident_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and visualization code.
- `accident_data.csv`: Dataset containing road traffic accident information.
- `models/`: Folder to save machine learning models (optional).

### Model Architecture

This project uses the following methods for analyzing traffic accident data:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and identifying factors that contribute to accidents.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Classification models to predict accident severity and type.

### Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
